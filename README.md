# Language Map
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f45a6b7a-7421-4357-a1a5-4a039594f215/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/langmap/deploys)

A react app for seeing what countries speak your language. Hosted at
[language-map.com](https://language-map.com).

Built from `yarn create react-app`. 

## Data
The data in this app is located in another repository,
[languagemap_data](https://github.com/malan88/languagemap_data). Please, if you
feel dissatisfied with one of the languages, its statuses, or its countries,
check that domain and contribute to `languages_final.csv`.

## To Use
I figure it's pretty self-explanatory. I may expand features later, but for now
if you'd like to share your map, just screenshot it.
